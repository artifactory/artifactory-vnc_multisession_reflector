vnc_multi_reflector
===================

*ez_multi_reflector* is an extension of const\_k's [VNC Reflector] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/vnc-reflector/) to enable multiple multi-user sessions on a single host.  In addition, a supplemental layer of authentication/permissioning is added, triangulated by a broker-authenticator.  

An existing implementation services the Desktop Sharing component of [*EZMeeting*](http://http://ezmeeting.com/).
